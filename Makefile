^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This repository contains tools and setups to demonstrate

as such:

~/assets:      contains misc stuff like certs/keys for general use
~/deployments: example deployments for docker-compose or k8s
~/init:        setup scripts to initialise k8s clusters
~/scripts:     some tooling makefiles
~/tools:       apps for concept demonstration (written in go)

Run `make bootstrap` to setup this repository for use.
