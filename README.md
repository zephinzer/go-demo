# Demos
A playground for container orchestration and cloud native applications.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zephinzer/go-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zephinzer/go-demo)

# Usage

The code is mostly self-documenting via the `Makefile`s in each directory. The convention in each directory enables you to run `make` in any of the non-WIP directories and see a help text output. Open the relevant `Makefile`s to check out what can be done.

If something's unclear/not right, feel free to [raise an issue](/zephinzer/go-demo/issues)!
